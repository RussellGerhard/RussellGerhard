- 👋 Hi, I’m @RussellGerhard
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack web projects that use Express or Flask with React, Pug, or Jinja2!
- 📫 You can reach me at russellgerhard1@gmail.com
- The next things I want to learn about are, in no particular order:
    - Redux
    - NextJS (and why people prefer it to template engines like Pug?)
    - Jest (and more production testing methods in general)
